At long last, Docket will now sync your lists with all your iOS devices. Through a new service called DocketAnywhere, you can work with the same lists on your iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad, and any changes you make on one will show up on all the others.

Your lists are stored in the cloud, so no matter where you are, your lists will stay up-to-date. And if you're without an internet connection, no worries! You can keep using Docket, and it will sync what you've done the next time you have a connection.

If you have an iPhone or iPod touch and were holding out on buying Pocket Docket because you couldn't have your lists on both, now's the time to buy. Docket and Pocket Docket both work with DocketAnywhere to ensure that you have your lists anywhere you go.
